IN PROGRESS...

Constructing NN to determine when Markov Chain step proposed by lattice QCD 
alogrithm will not produce change in global topological susceptibility. We 
begin by testing a simple input array consisting of the difference of plaquets 
averaged over Lambda QCD size boxes (roughly ~16 input values) -- we take this
box size since one expects the long range features to be subdominant in the 
determination of the topological susceptibility.
